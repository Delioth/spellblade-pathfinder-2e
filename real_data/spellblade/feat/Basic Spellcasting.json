Each time you gain a spell slot from spellblade feats, add a spell of the appropriate spell level to your repertoire: a common spell of your discipline's tradition, or another spell you have learned or discovered. If you have the Warpriest discipline and chose a deity, you may also choose from your deity's granted spells.\n\nYou gain a 1st level spell slot. When you reach 6th level, you gain a 2nd level spell slot, and may select one spell as a signature spell. When you reach 8th level, you gain a 3rd level spell slot.",
