  "markdown": "As part of Spellblade, I'm introducing two related mechanics; the Energizing trait and the Energized condition.\r\n\r\n**Energizing**: the Energizing trait always comes with a value. When you take an action with the energizing trait, increase your Energized condition by the value of the Energizing condition. \r\n\r\n**Energized**: The Energized condition  stacks up. It can be used for various Spellblade features. Any effects which give you a specific value of Energized increase your Energized condition by that amount. The Energized condition is removed when you leave Encounter mode.",
