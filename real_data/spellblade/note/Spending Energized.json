When a feature calls for you to spend Energized, you reduce your current Energized condition by that amount to gain the benefit described. So if Oni is currently Energized 3, and uses a feat which requires him to spend 2 Energized, he would lower his Energized condition by 2 to become Energized 1 to gain the feat's benefits.",
